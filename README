relatorio
=========

A templating library which provides a way to easily output all kind of
different files (odt, ods, png, svg, ...). Adding support for more filetype is
easy: you just have to create a plugin for this.

relatorio also provides a report repository allowing you to link python objects
and report together, find reports by mimetype/name/python object.

Note on PyCha
=============

Since the last release, pycha upstream author included most of my patches. So
there is no more need to use my friendly fork of the project. Although you can
use this version for the SVG support you should use the 'trunk' version.
