relatorio
=========

A templating library which provides a way to easily output all kind of
different files (odt, ods, png, svg, ...). Adding support for more filetype is
easy: you just have to create a plugin for this.

relatorio also provides a report repository allowing you to link python objects
and report together, find reports by mimetypes/name/pyhon objects.

Note on PyCha
=============

The current PyCha release is lacking at least a serious feature (support for
negative values) thus I created of "friendly fork" of PyCha in order to provide
this feature and some other.

The mercurial repository for this code can be found at

    http://hg.openhex.org/pycha
